# Direct Mail ROI Analysis and Experiment Design
This repo shows how I used Test &amp; Learn and AB testing to double ROI in a marketing department

## 📌 Background
A telecom company was mailing 3.5 million customers with upgrade offers. Marketing mix models suggested poor ROI. 
I supported the marketing team to redesign and validate their campaigns using controlled experiments.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a test planning and evaluation framework to:
- Validate whether direct mail campaigns drive significant uplift
- Identify segments where they are effective
- Avoid wasting money on ineffective campaigns

## 📈 Size of the Opportunity
- ~1M contactable customers at any time
- Monthly cap: ~500K customers contacted (including acquisition)
- €1 cost per mailer
- €6m annual budget
- Even a 0.1% uplift means 500 incremental conversions → potential €75K+ return

## 🧪 What This Repo Contains

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Not all statistically significant results are robust
- Segment-based targeting can radically improve ROI
- Communication to stakeholders was as critical as the math
