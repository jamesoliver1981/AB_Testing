# AB_Testing
This repo shows how I used Test &amp; Learn and AB testing to double ROI in a marketing department

Much of the intro will come from the walkthrough


To Do's
- mock up SQLs that I can add to these to demo how pulled these customers
- show the P&L that used to eval each campaign - create extra xlsx file and add pictures
- use the tool to determine what values to put into the walkthrough - match up for story - include the splits in these values and discuss its value
- how demo clustering with no data?
